Final Call For Papers

The 2012 International Conference on Brain Informatics (BI'12)

December 4-7, 2012, Macau SAR, China
http://www.fst.umac.mo/wic2012/BI/

A Special Event of the Alan Turing Year 
(Centenary of Alan Turing's birth)  
as part of World Intelligence Congress 2012

Turing Keynote Speaker: Edward Feigenbaum  
(1994 Turing Award Winner) 

Important Dates:
Electronic submission of full papers:  June 1, 2012
Notification of paper acceptance:      August 1, 2012
Camera-ready of accepted papers:       August 31, 2012
Workshops:                             December 4, 2012
Conference:                            December 5-7, 2012
******************************************************************

BI 2012 provides a leading international forum to bring together
researchers and practitioners that explore the interplay between
the studies of human brain and the research of informatics.
On the one hand, research of informatics opens a new avenue for
modeling and characterizing the human brain based on the
notions of information processing systems.  On the other hand,
informatics-enabled brain studies, e.g., based on fMRI, EEG, and
MEG, significantly broaden the spectrum of theories and models
of brain sciences and offer new insights into the development of
systems with human-level intelligence.

Web Intelligence centric information technologies are applied to
support brain science studies. For instance, the wisdom Web and
knowledge grids enable high-speed, large-scale analysis, simulation,
and computation as well as new ways of sharing research data
and scientific discoveries.

Topics
------------------------------------
High-quality papers in all BI related areas are solicited.
The topics and areas include, but not limited to:
- Human reasoning mechanisms
- Human learning mechanisms
- Human higher cognitive functions
- Systematic design of cognitive experiments
- HIPS meets complex systems
- Databasing the brain and constructing data brain models
- Formal conceptual models of human brain data
- Multi-media brain data mining
- Multi-aspect analysis in fMRI/EEG/MEG/PET

Papers exploring new directions will receive a careful and supportive
review. All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical
quality, relevance, significance, and clarity.

On-line Submissions and Publication
------------------------------------
The proceeding of the conference will be published by Springer
as a volume of the series of Lecture Notes in Computer Science/Lecture
Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNCS/LNAI).

Authors are strongly encouraged to use Springer LNCS/LNAI manuscript
submission guidelines (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html)
or their initial submissions (a maximum of 12 pages in Springer
LNCS/LNAI style file).  All papers must be submitted electronically
in PDF format only, using the conference management tool.

A selected number of the best papers from BI'12 will be expanded and
revised for possible inclusion in "Knowledge and Information Systems:
An International Journal" (http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~kais/) by Springer
and "Cognitive Systems Research: An International Journal"
(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/13890417) by Elsevier.

Awards
------
BI 2012 best paper awards and student paper awards will be
conferred on the authors at the conference.

Notes
-----
The BI 2012 will co-locate with WI'12, IAT'12, AMT'12, and ISMIS'12
as a Congress, a Special Event of the Alan Turing Year (Centenary
of Alan Turing's birth). The Congress will have a joint opening,
keynotes, reception and banquet.
