WI'12 provides a leading international forum to bring together
researchers and practitioners from diverse fields, to increase the
cross-fertilization of ideas and explore the fundamental roles,
interactions as well as practical impacts of Artificial Intelligence
engineering and Advanced Information Technology on the next generation
of Web systems.

Here AI-engineering is a general term that refers to a new area,
slightly beyond traditional AI: brain informatics, human level AI,
intelligent agents, social network intelligence and classical areas,
such as knowledge engineering, knowledge representation, planning,
knowledge discovery and data mining are examples.  Advanced
Information Technology includes wireless networks, ubiquitous devices,
social networks, data/knowledge grids, as well as service oriented
architecture, cloud computing.

Web Intelligence has been recognized as one of the most important as
well as promising direction for scientific research and development in
the era of Web and agent intelligence to bring in the next generation
Web systems.  The IEEE/WIC/ACM WI-IAT 2012 joint conferences
(WI-IAT'12) will co-locate with AMT'12, BI'12, and ISMIS'12 as a
Congress, a Special Event of the Alan Turing Year (Centenary of Alan
Turing's birth).  The Congress will have a joint opening, keynotes,
reception and banquet.

The topics and areas include, but not limited to:
1) Web Intelligence Foundations 
2) World Wide Wisdom Web  
3) Web Information Retrieval and Filtering 
4) Knowledge Grids and Grid Intelligence 
5) Semantics and Ontology Engineering 
6) Intelligent Human-Web Interaction 
7) Web Mining and Farming 
8) Social Networks 
9) Ubiquitous Intelligence
10) Web Agents 
11) Web Services 
12) Web Support Systems 
13) Intelligent E-Technology

High-quality papers in all WI related areas are solicited.  Paper
submissions should be limited to a maximum of 8 pages in the IEEE
2-column format.  The same format will be used for final camera-ready
papers (see the Author Guidelines at
http://www.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting).

All submitted papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee on the
basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity.

Note that WI'2012 will accept ONLY on-line submissions in PDF
format. Accepted papers will be published in the conference
proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society Press that is indexed by EI.
