Workshop on Modeling and Simulation on Grid and Cloud Computing, MSGC2012
(part of CCGRID 2102)
May 13-16 2012. Ottawa, ON, Canada.
CALL FOR PAPERS - NEW DEADLINE EXTENDED

http://www.sce.carleton.ca/faculty/wainer/MSGC2012

Sponsored by the IEEE, ACM and IEEE TCSC


The Workshop on Modeling and Simulation on Grid and Cloud Computing,
MSGC2012, focuses on the current challenges faced by the M&S community in
order to use advanced Grid and Cloud methodologies and middleware.

This workshop is motivated by the challenges brought by this new
participative model. Although the Grid and Cloud computing paradigms
introduced new ways of sharing computing power and storage in
heterogeneous environments, there are still many open questions in this
research area.

The objective is to bring experts in the field to address open questions
in this area. Topics include (but are not limited to):
-	Web Services, SOA and simulation
-	Simulation Middleware
-	Simulation Mashups using Grid and Cloud Computing
-	Wokflows for distributed simulation on the grid  - Service Composition
and Simulation
-	Composability and mashups using distributed simulation middleware on th=
e
grid
-	Simulation Data Management in Cloud Computing Environments
-	Interfacing Simulation with Web 2.0 Technologies
-	Grid and Cloud Simulation Tools and Environments

Submission Procedures:
The conference committee will accept full papers submitted as a PDF file
to the conference website
(https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmsgc2012). All the submitt=
