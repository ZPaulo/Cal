     CALL FOR PAPERS - TOASTS @ SASO 2012

     Workshop on Technologies for the Organisation,
     Adaptation and Simulation of Transportation Systems

     September 14, 2012, Lyon, France

     http://www.iis.ee.ic.ac.uk/TOASTS

     Deadline for submission: 4 July 2012

**********************************************************************

Year after year we are witnessing an increasing mobility of people
and goods around the globe, from everyday commuting, to holiday trips,
food and good distribution, and transportation related to ageing and
public health, among many others. All this trips can be made by many
different means of transportation (airplanes, public transport, private
cars, car pooling, public bicycles, etc.), each of them with its own
characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. As a consequence, the
management of the transportation system as a whole becomes a very
complex task, and it requires a better knowledge of users' travels
and behaviours as well as their interactions with their environment.
To carry out this work, modeling methods and simulation tools are
playing an increasingly importance for infrastructure design, network
  operation and new mobile services. In addition, the increasing pressure
  to mitigate the climate change has a major impact on logistics, and
companies world-wide must rethink their distribution strategies to
reduce their carbon footprint.

In light of this, self-adaptive and self-organising systems seem to
be very appropriate. On one hand, self-adaptive systems allow the
transportation systems to continuously adapt and cope with the dynamism
  of the environment (changing traffic conditions, dynamic demand,
accidents, etc.). On the other hand, self-organising systems let the
different involved actors to organise themselves, trying to achieve
their goals without the need of a central authority forcing them to
adopt a given behaviour. Also, the design of urban development and
deployment of digital services can be expressed as of complex and
self-* systems by the number and nature of the entities involved,
their interactions and their respective dynamics.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

The purpose of this workshop is to bring researchers and practitioners
together in order to set up visions on how methods and tools can be
used for ground transportation applications. Relevant topics include (but
are not limited to):

- Self-* principles in traffic and transportation systems
- Agent-based and multi-agent systems for traffic and intelligent vehicles
- Distributed decision making in traffic and transportation
- New digital services and agents in transportation systems
- Agent-based approaches to modelling driver and pedestrian behaviour
- Enactive systems in ground transportation
- Intelligent routing systems
- Traffic management systems
- Variable message sign systems
- Vehicle to vehicle communication systems
- Public transport management systems
- Autonomic supply chain systems

SUBMISSION

- Deadline for submission: 4 July 2012
- Acceptance notification: 25 July 2012
- Early registration deadline: 20 August 2012
- Camera-ready papers: 24 August 2012

The length of the papers may not exceed 6 pages including references and
must follow the IEEE Computer Society Press proceedings style guide. Papers
should be submitted in PDF format using the EasyChair system. In case of
acceptance, at least one author must attend the workshop to present it.
More information on how to format and submit the paper is available in
the workshop website: http://www.iis.ee.ic.ac.uk/TOASTS
