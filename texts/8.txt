PROPOR'2012

The 10th International Conference on the Computational Processing of Portug=

Coimbra, Portugal April 17-20, 2012

Demo Submission Deadline: March, 2, 2012

The International Conference on Computational Processing of Portuguese (PRO=
POR) organizers invite submissions for demonstrations. Following the spirit=
 of the Special Session of PROPOR 2008 and Demos Session of 2010, the PROPO=
R 2012 demonstration track aims at bringing together Academia and Industry =
and creating a forum where more than written or spoken descriptions of rese=
arch are available. Thus, demos should allow attendees to try and test them=
 during their presentation in a dedicated session adopting a more informal =
setting. Products, systems or tools are examples of acceptable demos. Both =
early-research prototypes and mature systems will be considered for present=
ation. The areas of interest include all topics related to theoretical and =
applied issues of written and spoken Portuguese, such as (but not limited t=
o) the topics listed for the conference paper submission (http://www.propor=
2012.org/call.html).

SUBMISSIONS

Submissions should consist of a non-anonymous brief description document of=
 up to three (3) pages of content including references. Developers must out=
line the main characteristics of their systems, provide sufficient details =
to allow its evaluation and give information on how they plan to demonstrat=
e their systems. Developers are encouraged to focus their description on th=
e relevance of the computational processing component of Portuguese languag=
e in the proposed system. Submitted documents should be written in English =
and sent by e-mail in PDF following the LNAI format to demos@propor2012.org.
Accepted demos and the accompanying description document will be published =
in the conference website.

PRESENTATION FORMAT

Accepted demos will be presented on table tops at a designated demo session=
 with an optional accompanying poster. Developers should make sure they can=
 run their demos properly. Thus, it is authors' responsibility to provide t=
he necessary technical conditions (equipments) for the demo at the conferen=
ce. Note that the local organizers will not provide any hardware or softwar=
e. Free high-speed Internet access will be available.
A Best Demo Award will be given out to the best demo presented during the c=
onference.
Further details on the date and time of the demonstration session(s) will b=
e determined and provided at a later date.

IMPORTANT DATES

* March 02, 2012 - Deadline for demos submission
* March 16, 2012 - Notification of acceptance
* April 17-20, 2012 - Conference
